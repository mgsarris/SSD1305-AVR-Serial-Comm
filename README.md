# SSD1305-AVR-Serial-Comm
Using the atmega328p's i2c (TWI) and USART interface, an SSD 1305 OLED display can display text using serial communication.

Future plans are to write the current weather condition and forcast to the display using a python program to get the information from the web and print it using the AVR's USART interface.


Here is the AVR and OLED on a breadboard (as well as the communication lines to the PC):
